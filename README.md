This is a simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript page. 

The content is a cheatsheet to a Project Management lecture.

Bordering each element while aligning helps me to grasp CSS flexbox.

In 'Nine Areas of Attention' section each Attention Button is listening for a click and onclick event triggers a function that will change a state of each button. I learnt to manage states of elements through JavaScript.

In the section about Issues and Risks JavaScript is listening for 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave' events changing background color to more color and back.
